# 2048
Fork of [Gabriele Cirulli's 2048](https://github.com/gabrielecirulli/2048) - a game inspired by [Veewo's 1024](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.veewo.a1024) and [Saming's 2048](https://saming.fr/p/2048/). This version includes some interface changes and has been restructured for Hugo site generation.

## Directions
Join the numbered tiles to reach **2048**! Use your arrow keys or swipe to move the tiles. When two tiles with the same number collide, they merge into one.
